# PatternRecognitionProject

## Design Ideal
The birds sound project will creating the new platform and let people understand the pattern sound of birds. It is helpful for people who like explorer and research to the birds in the nature world. Indeed, the project will face lot of difficult to define and classify sound of birds, and this is research field which has lot of confusion and weak. In the project, we will analyze and choice different the soundtrack to compare the sound of different type birds. In fact, there are many types of birds, different birds could have different and unique sound. We will be focus on how to identified these birds into group or individual. It is very difficult to use human hearing to figure out what kind of bird sometime even a bird research specialist, and our goal is create a tool to identify the sound of birdsâ€™frequency and how is send the message with other. To use the pattern recognition we may have new idea to think about birds and identify the bird what they are in nature world.

## Requirements
* Classify 10 different kind of birds
* Analyze the collecting Data by using Matlab
* Find the pattern by using different training set
* Identifier the bird by using different testing set

## Plan
**** SIX Weeks Project **** Goal: Identified 10 different birds

1. Data Collection
  1. BaldEagle.wav

  5. Hawk.wav
  6. Merlin.wav
  7. Owl.wav
  8. Parots.wav
  9. Peacock.wav
  10. Rooster.wav

2. Data Analysis
